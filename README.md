# Research Project: Visualizing COVID19 data from different countries

## Task

At the moment countries are being compared between each other through their COVID19 related statistics: confirmed cases, hospitalizations, case fatalities, excess and total mortality, sometimes per capita. However, this might not be the most informative way. This is as the dynamics of the virus are regional and different countries will have different population structures (e.g. UK: many large cities, Sweden: a huge amount of the population in Stockholm). Therefore, comparing country-wide statistics could be misleading.

The aim of the project is to develop software that downloads COVID19, mortality and population data and then to provide visualizations comparing different countries through the similarity of their regions. First one identifies regions that are most similar (e.g. similar population size and/or density). Then one aligns the time-series curves of their statistics and scores how much they differ. Based on the differences between regions one can cluster, seriate the countries. There are multiple ways of clustering, visualizing such similarities (e.g. classical k-means or Czekanowski's diagrams). The implemented software's visualizations should be both general comparison of countries and also detailed regional comparisons (between multiple countries).

## Course description

The aim of this course is to give the student the opportunity to

* apply methods from machine learning or data mining in a real setting,
* plan, perform and report on an individual task, and
* discuss research and development work in machine learning or related area.

The student is supposed to join an ongoing project or research in machine learning or data mining leaded by some IDAs researcher and study the origin of the problem and the research related to it, and analyze the given problem by using methods and tools from machine learning or data mining. The project is supposed to be research related, and after the course the students are supposed to get a better understanding of what research work implies. Accordingly, the project proposals defined by students themselves will not be accepted by default (with a rare exception of when the project is of interest for some of the IDAs researchers and the researcher is explicitly willing to invest his/her time in this student formulated project).

The course is runs on 20% rate and worth 6 ECTS credits and, thus, the course workload corresponds approximately to 1 working day per week during the entire semester (16 weeks). The project is assumed to be performed with a very limited help from supervisor, up to 3 hours in total. The project is supposed to **result in a report** containing around **3-4 pages** and some other material requested in the project description; this report must be sent to the supervisor and to the course leader at latest on **5th of January 2021**. An oral presentation of the results should also be performed for the supervisor.

### Step-by-step instructions

- [x] Find a research project. A list of the projects is available at LISAM, if you are interested of research of a particular IDA researcher and there is no project in the list from this person, you may contact him/her by email and ask if he/she can provide you such a project.
- [x] Mail the following project details to the course leader at latest on 3rd of September (better earlier):
    * Title
    * Short description (appr. 3 sentences)
    * Name of the supervisor
- [ ] Do the job. There will be no lectures or other scheduled course sessions â€“ you are only performing the given task with a very limited support from your supervisor. The supervisor will basically do a short introduction to the project and then you will probably have some mail conversations/very short meetings where you can ask some questions related to your project. Your work on the project will thus be almost independent by default.
- [ ] Write a final report containing approximately 3-4 pages that describes the background, the problem and your results and send the report to the course leader and your supervisor at latest on 5th of January 2021. Submit it also to LISAM, folder Submissions.
- [ ] You are also supposed to make a short presentation for your supervisor in order to report your results. Decide some date and time for this with your supervisor: the presentation should be done before  15th of January 2021.
- [ ] Ask the supervisor to send a message to the course leader proposing a grade (A-F) and a short motivation for this grade (3-4 sentences).
- [ ] Get the grade: the grade (A-F) will be heavily based on the feedback from your supervisor.
